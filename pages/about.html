            <p><span class="about-us-text we">We're "Rip-Off Games," but the only thing we're "ripping off" is the shrink-wrap on a golden age of gaming. We're a team of passionate collectors and lifelong gamers who believe the classics never die. Our mission is simple: to bring the magic of the 8-bit and 16-bit eras back to life.</span></p>
            <p><span class="about-us-text we">We hunt down the most iconic consoles and beloved titles—from the revolutionary NES to the legendary Sega Genesis—and make sure they're ready for a new generation of players. Every item in our store is a piece of history, a portal back to simpler times, and a guaranteed dose of pure, unfiltered fun.</span></p>
