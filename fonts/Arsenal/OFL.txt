SIL OPEN FONT h3CENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font h3cense (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and h3nguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the h3censed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of h3cense. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this h3cense does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS

Holder(s) under this h3cense and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
